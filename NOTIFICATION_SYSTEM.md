# Comprehensive Notification System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a complete notification system that triggers on 7 different user actions and displays notifications with unread badge in the sidebar.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Notification Types
All 7 notification types are now fully functional:

1. **Follow** - When someone follows you
2. **New Post** - When someone you follow posts something new
3. **Post Like** - When someone likes your post
4. **Post Comment** - When someone comments on your post
5. **Post Repost** - When someone reposts your post
6. **Comment Reply** - When someone replies to your comment
7. **Comment Like** - When someone likes your comment

### 2. Backend Implementation

#### Created Files:
- **`lib/notifications.ts`** - Centralized notification helper utility
  - `createNotification()` function with proper type safety
  - Prevents self-notifications (user can't notify themselves)
  - Stores in `activities.notifications` collection

#### Modified API Endpoints:
All endpoints now create notifications when appropriate:

1. **`app/api/users/follow/route.ts`**
   - Creates 'follow' notification when user follows someone
   - Notification: "{name} started following you"

2. **`app/api/posts/create/route.ts`**
   - Notifies all followers when user creates a post
   - Notification: "{name} posted something new"
   - Loops through all followers array

3. **`app/api/posts/like/route.ts`**
   - Notifies post owner when post is liked
   - Notification: "{name} liked your post"
   - Only creates notification when liking (not unliking)

4. **`app/api/posts/repost/route.ts`**
   - Notifies original post author when reposted
   - Notification: "{name} reposted your post"

5. **`app/api/posts/[id]/comments/route.ts`**
   - Creates 'comment' notification for top-level comments
   - Creates 'comment_reply' notification for nested replies
   - Includes recursive parent comment finder
   - Notifications:
     - "{ name} commented on your post" (top-level)
     - "{name} replied to your comment" (nested)

6. **`app/api/posts/[postId]/comments/[commentId]/like/route.ts`**
   - Already implemented in previous session
   - Notification: "{name} liked your comment"

### 3. Frontend Implementation

#### Notification Badge:
- **`components/layout/NotificationLink.tsx`**
  - Shows red badge with unread count
  - Displays "9+" if more than 9 unread
  - Polls API every 30 seconds for new notifications
  - Real-time updates without page refresh

#### Notification Page:
- **`app/notification/page.tsx`**
  - Fetches all notifications from API
  - Displays with appropriate icons:
    - ‚ù§Ô∏è Heart (red) - likes and comment likes
    - üí¨ Message - comments and replies
    - üë§ User Plus (green) - follows
    - üîÅ Repeat (green) - reposts
    - üí¨ Message (purple) - new posts
  - Shows unread indicator (blue dot)
  - Marks as read when clicked
  - Navigates to relevant post/profile on click
  - Shows relative timestamps (now, 5m, 2h, 3d, etc.)
  - Empty state with helpful message

### 4. Database Schema

**Collection:** `activities.notifications`

```typescript
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  type: 'follow' | 'post' | 'like' | 'comment' | 'repost' | 'comment_like' | 'comment_reply',
  fromUser: {
    email: string,
    name: string,
    username?: string,
    image?: string | null
  },
  userEmail: string,  // recipient email
  postId?: string,
  commentId?: string,
  message: string,
  read: boolean,
  createdAt: Date
}
```

### 5. API Endpoints

**GET `/api/notifications`**
- Fetches user's notifications (limit 50)
- Sorted by `createdAt` descending
- Returns notifications with sender profile data

**POST `/api/notifications`**
- Creates new notification (internal use by other endpoints)

**PUT `/api/notifications`**
- Marks notification(s) as read
- Body: `{ notificationIds: string[] }`

## User Experience

1. **Real-time Updates**: Badge updates every 30 seconds
2. **Unread Count**: Red badge shows number of unread notifications
3. **Visual Indicators**: Blue dot on unread items
4. **Smart Navigation**: Click notification ‚Üí go to relevant content
5. **Mark as Read**: Automatically marks as read on click
6. **Responsive Icons**: Different icon for each notification type
7. **Time Display**: Human-readable relative timestamps

## Technical Details

### Notification Flow:
1. User performs action (like, comment, follow, etc.)
2. API endpoint calls `createNotification()`
3. Notification stored in database
4. Frontend polls `/api/notifications` every 30s
5. Badge count updates automatically
6. User clicks notification ‚Üí marked as read
7. User navigates to relevant content

### Performance Optimizations:
- Batch follower notifications (loop through followers array)
- Prevent self-notifications (fromUser.email !== toUserEmail)
- Limit 50 notifications per fetch
- Client-side caching with 30s polling interval
- Optimistic UI updates (mark as read immediately)

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Users without usernames (uses email)
- Users without profile images (shows initials)
- Deleted posts (no crash, just shows notification)
- Self-actions (prevented at backend)
- Missing follower arrays (handles empty arrays)

## Testing Checklist

‚úÖ Follow user ‚Üí notification created
‚úÖ Create post ‚Üí all followers notified
‚úÖ Like post ‚Üí post owner notified
‚úÖ Comment on post ‚Üí post owner notified

‚úÖ Repost post ‚Üí original poster notified
‚úÖ Like comment ‚Üí comment owner notified
‚úÖ Badge shows unread count

‚úÖ No self-notifications

## Future Enhancements (Optional)

- Push notifications (browser API)
- Email notifications for important actions
- Notification preferences/settings
- Group similar notifications ("X and 5 others liked your post")
- Real-time WebSocket updates instead of polling
- Notification history pagination
- Delete/clear all notifications
- Mute specific users' notifications
